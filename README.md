EDA on Covid19 data and prediction of Deaths, confirmed cases and Recovered cases using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression

Due to Covid- 19 the world is facing most horrible crises with respect to public health. With the help of this project, we can give good precautionary measures to prevent the spread of new strain of corona virus in INDIA. Even though we got the vaccine for Covid -19 we do not know if it helps to cure new strain of corona. So, it would be helpful to reduce the spread of new strain if they follow these precautionary measures. 
This project is implemented in two phases:
 1. Analysis of covid-19 cases: In this phase we first did the analysis of the dataset taken by dividing the data as per Lockdown dates. We collected the data from government websites and Kaggle repository. The study of present trend of covid-19 cases gives a possibility to develop best model.
 2. Prediction of covid-19 cases: Based on the analysis part, we have used two algorithms namely Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to predict future cases.
